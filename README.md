Artwork Inbox
=============

https://artworkinbox.azurewebsites.net/

An ASP.NET Core web application that provides an alternate UI for viewing your feed.

Supported sites:

* [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/)
* [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com)
* [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com)
* [Weasyl](https://www.weasyl.com) (artwork only, API key required)
* [Inkbunny](https://www.inkbunny.net) (artwork only, API access must be turned on)
* The Mastodon instance [botsin.space](https://botsin.space/)

Future ideas:
* Show notifications count (DeviantArt, Weasyl, Inkbunny)
* Allow posting status updates (DeviantArt, Twitter, Tumblr, Mastodon)

Note: clearing your feed items from within this app does not actually clear them from your feed - it just hides them from this app's view.
