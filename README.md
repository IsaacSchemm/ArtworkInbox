DANotify
========

An ASP.NET Core web application that provides an alternate UI for viewing your DeviantArt inbox.

Note: due to API limitations, clearing your notifications from this app does not actually clear them from DeviantArt - it just hides them from this app's view.

Currently working on:

* UX improvements

Future plans:

* Add Tumblr support (?)
* Add Weasyl support (?)
* Filter thumbnails of sensitive content
* `srcset`
